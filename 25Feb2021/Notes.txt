SPA: Single Page Application

The complete application runs on a single page (index.html), any navigation 
happens in application will change the content in index.html without 
refreshing / reloading the web page.


To implement SPA, we use react-router-dom

a ->  NavLink 

href -> to 

We use a class called HashRouter to specify routes.
